Daniel's Raman Data, Origin Files, and Python Code
This GitHub contains all of the raw Raman data, grouped by day it was gathered, and some information about what the samples were on that day. Additionally, it contains the initial origin graphs made for much of this data. Finally, it has a file with the python notebooks. The "Edited" and "New" notebooks are the most up-to-date, but the others are provided as well. 
Some raw files for the quantitative experiments are labelled with "25 75" and some with "one three." These are fundamentally the same, there was just a change in naming scheme midway through this project.
